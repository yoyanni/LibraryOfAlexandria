# What is SpEL?

SpEL or, Spring Expression Language, was inspired by the Expression Language used in Spring WebFlow and based on Unified Expression Language used in JSP (Java Server Pages) and JSF (Java Server Faces).

It is used/extended by other Spring-based frameworks.

# What happens when I use SpEL to access Properties?

[[2a - External Properties#Is there alternative? Yes, `@Value`.|Using `@Value` to access properties]]

Properties are Strings by default so a conversion may occur implicitly if necessary.

## You can also add Fallback Values.
