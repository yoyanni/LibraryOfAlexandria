A few questions to think about when developing an API:

- How is the API interacted with?
- What data is expected in certain scenarios?
- What data should be sent back and when?
- What happens with errors and what is returned?

The agreements of the discussions that were made for the above questions are what we call **contracts** - an agreed upon list of behaviours.

## API Contracts

Two examples of the contracts are:

- **Consumer Driven Contracts**
- **Provider Driven Contracts**

An API contract as a formal agreement between a software provider and a consumer that abstractly communicates how to interact with each other. This contract defines how API providers and consumers interact, what data exchanges looks like, and how to communicate success and failure cases.

API contracts are important because they communicate the behavior of a REST API and are written in such a way to easily implement automated tests.

## What is JSON?

JSON (Javascript Object Notation) provides a data interchange format that represents the particular information of an object in a format that you can easily read and understand.

Other popular data formats:

* YAML
* XML
