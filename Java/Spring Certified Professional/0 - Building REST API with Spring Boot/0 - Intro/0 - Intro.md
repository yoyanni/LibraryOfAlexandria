## Spring

Spring is a framework that provides various modules to build different types of applications. 

Modules we will use:
- **Spring MVC** - for the web application
- **Spring Data** - for data access
- **Spring Security** - for authentication and authorization
## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is like a more opinionated version of Spring. It comes with many pre-configured setting and dependencies to be able to start applications quickly.

**Note:** Spring boot has an embedded web server which makes it able to create and deploy without any external server help.

## Inversion of Control Container

Spring Boot is able to choose how and when dependencies are provided to your application at runtime. 

Inversion of control is often called **dependency injection (DI)** which is not strictly correct. DI is one way of achieving inversion of control.

## Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr helps with setting up new applications with all the dependencies requested.

General flow of Spring Initializr is to fill in the metadata, add relevant dependencies and generate your new project.
