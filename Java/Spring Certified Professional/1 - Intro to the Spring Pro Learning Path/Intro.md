# Purpose

 The labs in this course teach key concepts in the context of a problem domain. The _Reward Dining_ application provides a real-world context for applying the techniques you have learned to develop useful business applications.

This section provides an overview of the domain and the applications you will be working on within it.

# Domain Overview

The Domain is called _Reward Dining_. The idea is that customers can save money every time they eat at one of the restaurants participating in the network - a "_Frequent Flyer_" program for restaurants.

For example, Keith would like to save money for his children's education. Every time he dines at a restaurant participating in the network, a contribution is made to his account.

The account contribution (reward) will be shared by his two children Annabelle and Corgan. Thus Annabelle gets a fund to help her with her college fees.


# The Domain Applications

This next section provides an overview of the applications in the Reward Dining domain that you will be working on in this course.

## The Rewards Application

The "rewards" application rewards an account for dining at a restaurant participating in the reward network. A reward takes the form of a monetary contribution to an account that is distributed among the account's beneficiaries. Here is how this application is used:

1. When they are hungry, members dine at participating restaurants using their regular credit cards.
2. Every two weeks, a file containing the dining credit card transactions made by members during that period is generated. A sample of one of these files is shown below:
    ```swift
    AMOUNT    CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER    MERCHANT_NUMBER    DATE
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    100.00  1234123412341234    1234567890      12/29/2010
    49.67   1234123412341234    0234567891      12/31/2010
    100.00  1234123412341234    1234567890      01/01/2010
    27.60   2345234523452345    3456789012      01/02/2010
    ```
3. A standalone `DiningBatchProcessor` application reads this file and submits each Dining record to the rewards application for processing.

### Public Application Interface

The `RewardNetwork` is the central interface clients such as the `DiningBatchProcessor` use to invoke the application:
```java
    public interface RewardNetwork {
        RewardConfirmation rewardAccountFor(Dining dining);
    }
```

It is the only _service-layer_ component in the application.

A `RewardNetwork` rewards an account for dining by making a monetary contribution to the account that is in turn distributed among the account's beneficiaries. The sequence diagram below shows a client's interaction with the application illustrating this process:

![[Pasted image 20240804104835.png]]

In this example, the account with credit card _1234123412341234_ is rewarded for a spending _$100.00_ at a restaurant with Merchant ID _1234567890_ on 29th December 2010 (date is in North American date format).

The confirmed reward, number 9831, takes the form of an _$8.00_ account contribution distributed evenly among beneficiaries Annabelle and her brother Corgan.

### Internal Application Implementation

Internally, the `RewardNetwork` implementation delegates to domain objects to carry out a `rewardAccountFor(Dining)` transaction. Classes exist for the two central domain concepts of the application: `Account` and `Restaurant`.

- A `Restaurant` is responsible for calculating the benefit eligible to an account for a dining.
- An `Account` is responsible for distributing the benefit among its beneficiaries as a "contribution".

This flow is shown below:

![[Pasted image 20240804105634.png]]

The `RewardNetwork` asks the `Restaurant` to calculate how much benefit to award, then contributes that amount to the `Account`.

For convenience the `rewards-common` project contains a number of helper classes:

- `MonetaryAmount` wraps a `BigDecimal` and holds an amount to 2 decimal places.
- `Percentage` wraps a `BigDecimal` and holds a percentage to 2 decimal places.

### Supporting Reward Network Components

Account and restaurant information are stored in a persistent form inside a relational database. The `RewardNetwork` implementation delegates to supporting data access components called 'Repositories' to load `Account` and `Restaurant` objects from their relational representations.

- An `AccountRepository` is used to find an `Account` by its credit card number
- A `RestaurantRepository` is used to find a `Restaurant` by its merchant number.
- A `RewardRepository` is used to track confirmed reward transactions for accounting purposes. It holds the same data as the `RewardConfirmation` in the diagram (Figure 5) above.

A `Dining` record contains:

- Customer's credit-card number
- Merchant id of the restaurant
- Amount paid for the meal
- Date the customer dined (unused in our simple implementation)

The full `rewardAccountFor(Dining)` sequence incorporating these repositories is:

- Fetch the `Account` from the `AccountRepository`
- Fetch the `Restaurant` from `RestaurantRepository`
- Determine the Reward contribution (an instance of `MonetaryAmount`) using `Restaurant.calculateBenefitFor(Account, Dining)`
- Update the account beneficiaries using `Account.makeContribution(MonetaryAmount)`
- Save modified Account information using `AccountRepository.updateBeneficiaries(Account)`
- Create a `RewardConfirmation` using the `RewardRepository`

# Reward Dining Database Schema

The Reward Dining applications use a database with this schema:

![[Pasted image 20240804110318.png]]

In most of the labs, a test database is provided for you. It is populated with test data by running scripts in `00-rewards-common/src/main/resources/rewards/testdb`. They are available as classpath resources.

There are two scripts:

- `schema.sql` - creates the necessary tables, and
- `data.sql` - adds test data (several accounts and a single restaurant)
