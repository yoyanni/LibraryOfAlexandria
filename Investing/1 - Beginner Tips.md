### Key Principles for Beginners

1. **Start Early**: The sooner you start investing, the more time your money has to grow through compounding.
2. **Invest Regularly**: Make consistent investments over time rather than trying to time the market.
3. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with financial news and market trends.
4. **Be Patient**: Investing is a long-term endeavor. Avoid panic selling during market downturns.
5. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor, especially if you're new to investing.
