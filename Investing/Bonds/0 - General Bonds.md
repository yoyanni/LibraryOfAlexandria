### What are Bonds?

Bonds are debt securities issued by corporations, municipalities, governments, or other entities to raise capital. When you purchase a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value (principal) when it matures.

### Key Concepts to Know About Bonds

1. **Types of Bonds**:
    
    - **Government Bonds**: Issued by national governments. Examples include U.S. Treasury bonds.
    - **Municipal Bonds**: Issued by states, cities, or other local government entities. Often tax-exempt.
    - **Corporate Bonds**: Issued by companies to raise capital.
    - **Treasury Bonds, Notes, and Bills**: Different durations of government bonds. Bonds (>10 years), Notes (1-10 years), Bills (<1 year).
    - **Zero-Coupon Bonds**: Sold at a discount and pay no periodic interest, but the face value is repaid at maturity.
2. **Bond Characteristics**:
    
    - **Face Value (Par Value)**: The amount paid back to the bondholder at maturity.
    - **Coupon Rate**: The interest rate the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond.
    - **Maturity Date**: The date on which the bond will mature, and the principal amount will be repaid.
    - **Yield**: The rate of return on the bond. It can be the current yield (annual interest payment divided by the current bond price) or yield to maturity (total return anticipated if the bond is held until it matures).
3. **How Bonds Work**:
    
    - **Issuance**: Bonds are issued with specific terms, including the coupon rate and maturity date.
    - **Interest Payments**: Bondholders receive periodic interest payments (usually semiannual).
    - **Maturity**: At maturity, the issuer repays the bond's face value to the bondholder.
4. **Bond Prices and Market Value**:
    
    - Bond prices can fluctuate based on interest rates, the issuer's credit rating, and market demand.
    - **Premium and Discount**: Bonds can trade above (premium) or below (discount) their face value.
    - **Interest Rates and Bond Prices**: Inversely related. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa.
